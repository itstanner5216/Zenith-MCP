# Zenith-MCP

> **The MCP filesystem your agent actually deserves.** Stop pasting line numbers. Stop grepping. Stop hoping your multi-file refactor didn't silently break the one odd function with a different signature. Zenith reads code like you do — by structure, not text — and edits it with the precision of an IDE engine, not a text replacement tool.

## Why Zenith?

Most MCP filesystem servers give you a hammer and ask you to sculpt. Zenith gives you a precision instrument intentionally built for serious AI-assisted development. Not just read and write — Zenith gives your AI agent genuine code intelligence: AST-aware editing, impact-graph refactoring, semantic search, and a version-controlled symbol database, all inside a hardened security sandbox.

| Capability | Typical MCP server | Zenith-MCP |
|---|---|---|
| **Edit precision** | Full-file overwrite or fragile text replacement | 3-mode surgical editing: content-match, block-boundary, or **AST symbol** — no line numbers needed |
| **Code understanding** | None | Tree-sitter AST parsing for **40+ languages**, lazy-loaded WASM, LRU-cached |
| **Search intelligence** | Grep or basic glob | BM25 pre-filter + ripgrep + BM25 post-rank, structural similarity, definition lookup |
| **Cross-file refactoring** | Not available | Impact-graph traversal (callers/callees), outlier detection, atomic multi-file apply with rollback |
| **Edit safety** | Write and hope | All-or-nothing in-memory validation → atomic temp-file swap → SQLite stash on failure |
| **Symbol versioning** | Not available | Every symbol edit auto-snapshots the original; point-in-time rollback via `refactor_batch` |
| **Security model** | CWD or basic prefix check | `validatePath` with symlink resolution + re-check, exclusive-write `wx` flag, sensitive-file blocking, per-session isolation |
| **Transport** | stdio only | stdio **and** HTTP (Streamable HTTP + legacy SSE, bearer auth, per-session context, idle reaping) |

## What It Does (And Why It Matters)

### True code-awareness via Tree-sitter

Zenith ships WASM grammars for JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, C#, Kotlin, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Bash, CSS, JSON, YAML, SQL, Markdown, Dart, Elixir, GraphQL, HCL, HTML, Lua, Make, Nix, Perl, Prisma, Proto, R, SCSS, Svelte, TOML, Vue, XML, CMake, Dockerfile, and more. Grammars are lazy-loaded on first use and cached after first load — minimal startup penalty.

This unlocks capabilities that are simply impossible with text search:

- **`edit_file` symbol mode** — "Replace the `AuthService.login` method" without knowing its line number. Zenith finds the AST bounds and replaces exactly the right block, then re-indents the new code to match the file.
- **`search_file` symbol lookup** — Read just the body of `BM25Index.score` across a 10,000-line file, with optional surrounding context.
- **`search_files` structural mode** — Find all functions with the same AST shape (Jaccard similarity over 3-gram node fingerprints) to detect copy-paste patterns or candidates for a common abstraction.
- **`search_files` definition mode** — Locate every file that *defines* `AuthService.login` using the parse tree, not a fragile regex.
- **Syntax gate** — After any edit, `syntaxWarn()` walks the new AST and warns if `ERROR` or missing nodes were introduced.

### Intelligent two-stage search

Searching a 50,000-file monorepo without drowning the LLM context is a hard problem. Zenith solves it with a pipeline:

1. **BM25 pre-filter** — builds an in-memory BM25 corpus (file paths weighted 3×, first 8 KB of content) and selects the top-100 candidate files.
2. **ripgrep** — blazing-fast regex search scoped to those 100 files (with `.gitignore` awareness). Falls back to a pure-JS implementation when `rg` isn't available.
3. **BM25 post-rank** — if results exceed 50 lines, BM25 re-ranks individual result lines and fills the character budget with the most relevant hits.

The BM25 implementation is zero-dependency, inline (~120 lines), and uses entropy weighting (high-entropy terms are downweighted) plus sigmoid TF saturation for better precision than vanilla BM25.

### All-or-nothing atomic edits with stash recovery

Edit safety is not an afterthought. Every `edit_file` call:

1. Validates **all** edits against an in-memory copy of the file — exact match, then trimmed-whitespace match, then indent-stripped match within a ±50-line window.
2. If **any** edit fails, **zero** edits are applied and the file is untouched.
3. Failed edits are stashed to SQLite with their full payload. The AI retries via `stashRestore apply` with only the correction needed — unchanged edits rehydrate from the stash automatically.
4. Successful edits write to a temp file, verify the byte size, then `fs.rename()` for an atomic swap.

Block edits (`block_start` / `block_end`) and symbol edits (AST-located) follow the same pipeline.

### Cross-file impact refactoring

`refactor_batch` implements a full refactoring workflow:

1. **`query`** — traverses the per-project SQLite symbol graph (`edges` table) to find all callers (`forward`) or callees (`reverse`) of a symbol, up to 5 levels deep.
2. **`loadDiff`** — fetches each symbol's body plus N lines of context. Runs **outlier detection**: computes `getSymbolStructure()` for each occurrence (param shape, return type, decorators, modifiers, parent scope) and flags deviations from the modal pattern.
3. **`apply`** — parses a diff-style payload, gates on acknowledged outliers and syntax validity, then applies edits atomically per file. Successful patterns are cached for `reapply`.
4. **`reapply`** — applies a cached edit pattern to new targets without repeating the full workflow.

### Per-project symbol database

Each git repository gets a `.mcp/symbols.db` (auto-gitignored) with:
- `symbols` — definitions and references from the full Tree-sitter parse
- `edges` — caller → callee links for impact traversal
- `versions` — point-in-time snapshots of every symbol body touched by `edit_file` or `refactor_batch`, with a configurable TTL

Rollback is a single tool call: `refactor_batch restore`.

### TOON compression engine

The `zenith-toon` package provides intelligent context compression for tool outputs:

- **Structure-aware**: Uses tree-sitter AST analysis to identify code structure, preserving signature headers while compressing interior blocks.
- **BMX-Plus scoring**: An original, unpublished lexical search algorithm created by the project author. Built on BM25's TF saturation curve with three innovations: term-adaptive entropy-aware IDF (γ_t = IDF_t / IDF_max), variance-blended informativeness (Shannon entropy ↔ IDF smoothly interpolated via TF variance), and tanh Soft-AND coverage bonus. All executed within a TAAT (Term-At-A-Time) posting-list architecture. Uses **no pre-trained models** — purely algorithmic. Benchmarked against standard BM25 across 9 BEIR datasets (~8.2M documents total), achieving **1.5–26× speedups** (median ~3.7×) while NDCG@10 deltas stay within ±0.02 of BM25.
- **SageRank**: Multi-signal importance ranking for text segments (structural importance, semantic density, position, references).
- **Budget management**: Character-aware budget allocation ensures tool outputs fit within context windows without losing critical information.

### Security-first design

- **`validatePath()`** — expands `~`, normalizes, prefix-checks against allowed directories, calls `fs.realpath()` to resolve symlinks, then re-checks the resolved path. Throws before any `fs` call if the check fails.
- **Exclusive writes** — new file creation uses the `wx` flag. Pre-existing symlinks at the target path cannot be exploited.
- **Sensitive file blocking** — `isSensitive()` uses `minimatch` globs to block `.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*credentials*`, `*secret*`, and more from appearing in search results and symbol indexing.
- **Per-session isolation (HTTP)** — each HTTP client gets its own `FilesystemContext`. MCP root negotiations for one session never affect another.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** ≥ 22.0.0 (required for native `node:sqlite`)
- **pnpm** 11+

### stdio (Local)

Standard MCP stdio transport for local clients like Claude Desktop or VS Code.

```bash
npx zenith-mcp /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2
```

### HTTP (Remote)

Express-based HTTP server supporting both Streamable HTTP and legacy SSE transports.

```bash
ZENITH_MCP_API_KEY=secret npx zenith-mcp-http /path/to/dir1 --port=3100 --host=0.0.0.0
```

**HTTP Endpoints:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/mcp` | Streamable HTTP (initialize + messages) |
| `GET` | `/mcp` | Streamable HTTP SSE notification stream |
| `DELETE` | `/mcp` | Streamable HTTP session teardown |
| `GET` | `/sse` | Legacy SSE transport |
| `POST` | `/messages` | Legacy SSE message endpoint |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |

Sessions are isolated per client and reaped after 30 minutes of idle time (configurable via `session_ttl_ms` in `~/.zenith-mcp/config`). All HTTP requests require `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`.

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itstanner5216/zenith-mcp.git
cd zenith-mcp
pnpm install
pnpm build     # Builds zenith-toon first, then zenith-mcp
```

---

## Directory Access Control

Directories can be specified via command-line arguments or dynamically via [MCP Roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#roots).

### Method 1: Command-line Arguments
```bash
zenith-mcp /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2
```

### Method 2: MCP Roots (Recommended)
MCP clients that support Roots can dynamically update allowed directories at runtime via `roots/list_changed` notifications. Roots completely replace server-side directories when provided.

**Important:** If the server starts without CLI directories AND the client doesn't support roots (or provides empty roots), initialization will fail.

> **Why no fallback?** Allowed directories are a strict security sandbox — they determine what the AI can read and write. The server intentionally does *not* fall back to `process.cwd()` or auto-detected git roots for allowed directories, because that could accidentally expose sensitive files. A separate "project root" resolver (used only for the symbol index and stash database) does have fallbacks (git → marker detection → registry → global), but that layer never grants filesystem access.

### How It Works
1. **Server Startup** — uses CLI directories as the baseline
2. **Client Initialization** — if the client supports roots, the server requests `roots/list` and replaces allowed directories
3. **Runtime Updates** — `notifications/roots/list_changed` triggers a refresh
4. **Access Control** — all filesystem operations are restricted to allowed directories; symlinks are resolved and validated
